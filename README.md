Pre-requisites:
- Have node installed (v20.10.0 works)

Once repo has been cloned locally, run ``npm install``
- This will install all dependencies required

To start the server, run ''npm run start''
- This will execute the "start" script defined in *package.json*, ``nodemon server.js``

Navigate to your browser and open http://localhost:3000, and it should start the default tictactoe game and it should log in the console socket connections to the server
